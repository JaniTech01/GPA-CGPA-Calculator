## 🧮 How It Works

### 🔹 CGPA Calculation
To calculate CGPA, SmartGPA asks for:
- Subject-wise **marks** (e.g., 85, 74, etc.)
- Corresponding **credit hours**

The app:
1. Converts marks into grade points based on GCUF rules
2. Multiplies each grade point by its credit hours
3. Divides the total by overall credit hours to give your **CGPA**

### 🔹 GPA Calculation
To calculate GPA, SmartGPA asks only for:
- The **CGPAs of previous semesters**

It then:
- Computes the weighted average GPA
- Gives you your **updated GPA**, helping you track performance

This makes it ideal for students who already know their semester CGPAs and just want to calculate their overall average.
